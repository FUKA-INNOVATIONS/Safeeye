Based on your location information and any recorded messages, your contacts can then decide what is the best way to help you.\n\nTo add a new contact, navigate to 'Connections' tab. Copy your personal 'connection code' and share it with your friends. They then can search for you on Safeye using your code and add you as a contact.
